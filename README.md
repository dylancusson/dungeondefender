**Dungeon Defender** is a Strategy-Defense Roguelike game developed by Team Placeholder for Cal State San Bernardino's Game Design course.

## 🎮 Game Overview

In **Dungeon Defender**, you are a powerful Warlock defending your lair. As your power grows, adventurers—ranging from warriors and paladins to rogues and mages—become stronger and more capable in their attempts to take you down.

### Core Features
* **Hybrid Gameplay:** A mix of RTS, Tower Defense, and Roguelike mechanics.
* **Dungeon Building:** Unlock and craft specific dungeon rooms to access new traps and minions.
* **Traps & Minions:** Deploy spike traps, slowing fields, and barricades, or summon minions like skeletons, orcs, and golems to hold the line.
* **Powerful Spells:** Unleash high-impact magic like Fireballs or Blizzards. Spells are powerful but have limited uses per level, requiring strategic timing.
* **Progression:** Earn souls from slain adventurers to fuel your summons and spells.

### Game Modes
1.  **Campaign:** Learn the ropes in levels designed to introduce core mechanics (summoning, trapping, spellcasting).
2.  **Endless Mode:** Face endlessly scaling challenges with random enemy types, modifiers, and dungeon layouts.
